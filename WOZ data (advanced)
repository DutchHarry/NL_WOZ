WOZ data (advanced)

Previous attempts give you some WOZ data, but not necessarily all of what's available.
How can we know all? How can we know the relevant ids? And how can we extract it, even without BAG data?

1 Ask for total per 'gemeentecode'
You cannot know beforehand how many woz-objects exists in the DB
So we check by asking for the whole range vor each gemeente
The value will be in totalFeatures.

2. Page through all objects
We have to check first which objects exist.
Once we have the whole range of objects we can start asking each 'wobj_bag_obj_id' or  'wobj_obj_id' for WOZ value and peildatum
For efficiency you can use the data from the 1st step as the first page of 500 objects.
500 objects is currently the maximum number you can get in one request

3. Get values for relevant objects
Unfortunately you won't get woz-waarde and 'peildatum' when asking for a range.
Loop through all relevant wobj_bag_obj_id and where these don't give WOZ values, revert to wobj_obj_id

Notes:
Check if wobj_obj_id also give values, just like wobj_bag_obj_id? A: Yes
For some gemeenten above route showed that up to 10% of DB-entries was missed in earlier approaches.
Max totalfeatures returning with a WOZ value using wobj_bag_obj_id is 56, but there are several with less which don't return a WOZ value.
Using only wobj_bag_obj_id misses about 1m wobj_obj_id wh woz-value and 'peildatum', that's between 5 and 10%.
