wozwaardeloket has changed to a new layout
If you extract the json WOZ data you don;t get the sqm oppervlakte
The 'oppervlakte' shown on site is the most recent value from BAG, so not necessarily related to actual sqm on peildatum.
That's confusing, to say the least, as WOZ is supposed to move to a more grounde valuation per sqm.
So you would expect the sqm be included in the WOZ data, but it isn't!
